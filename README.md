#Projeto-Workouts

##Why did I choose this project?

After completing my first HTML5 and CSS course, I realized the importance of further practicing my skills. To do so, I sought out simple projects on Figma that would allow me to apply what I had learned.
This particular layout was designed by Pio (https://www.figma.com/@pio), a Figma user who shared his design with the community.

##What is this project?

This project is the homepage of a workout website, featuring a brief description and a header menu.
I plan to enhance it by adding two additional pages, which will be linked to the menu buttons, creating a more complete and user-friendly experience.
